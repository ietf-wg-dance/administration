    - A number of comments received
    - Some discussion on the list
    - Mostly radio silence afterward

*** Last Call Comments from *draft-ietf-dance-client-auth*

    *draft-ietf-dance-client-auth:*
    - A number of comments received
    - Some discussion on the list
    - Mostly radio silence afterward

*** Goal today

    - *Goal:* Resolve these finally with mic discussion
    - *Discussion structure:*
      - We describe the comment
      - We propose a "Suggestion" path forward based on the
        comment/discussion to date
      - You talk
      - We take consensus
    - DANCE!
    - (and we verify the results on the list)

* Last call comment discussion: draft-ietf-dance-client-auth

*** Comments on

    + Resolving LC comments about *draft-ietf-dance-client-auth*

*** Examples needed

    \commentfrom{Rick van Rein}

    \notes
    - could use examples for:
      - domain names
      - wildcards and DANE-TA

    \suggestion{Volunteer needed to add an easy example}\\
    \suggestion{/or/ point to architecture document?}
    \suggestion{/or/ point to use-cases document?}

*** Encoding the transport label

    \commentfrom{Michael Richardson}
    
    \notes
    - The transport label encoding may not be needed,
    - both TLS and DTLS are functionally dual-usable already
    - the current draft already says the transport label is not needed

    \suggestion{leave as is}

*** clarity on the security considerations

    \commentfrom{Robert Moskowitz}

    \notes
    - Are there privacy concerns because of client identity harvesting
      in DANCE?
    - do we need a better security consideration section description?

    \suggestion{Mention this consideration in the secruity consideration}

*** X.509 certificates should be a MUST

    \commentfrom{Michael Richardson}

    \notes
    - Why is there an exception that allows for SHOULD when using
      X.509 certificate

    \suggestion{Change it to MUST}

*** Nits

    \commentfrom{Michael Richardson}

    \notes
    - Smaller wording suggestions and nits IRT DNSSEC validation,
      distinction between TLS and DTLS, [_service] and device
      notation, references for both RFCs and inactive drafts
    - Message-ID: 763667.1668330590@dyas

    \suggestion{Accept and act on the nits}

* Last call comments about draft-ietf-dance-tls-clientid

*** LC comments

    + resolving LC comments for *draft-ietf-dance-tls-clientid*

*** Needs a check regarding the supported TLS version

    \commentfrom{Michael Richardson}


    \notes
    - We have a reference to TLS 1.2 and 1.3 and DTLS 1.3
    - We have a reference to RFC8446 (framing extension)

    \suggestion{This extension supports both TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], and future TLS versions.Â  DTLS [RFC6347] is also supported. The term TLS in this document is used generically to describe all protocols.}

    \suggestion{A reference to RFC6066 is not needed (TLS extensions)}

*** Request for clarity on the ClientName limit definition

    \commentfrom{Rick van Rein and Michael Richardson}

    \notes
    - dane_clientid extensions defined as <1..255>
    - TLS encodes names as ascii
    - DNS encodes them as 255 character limit names
      - (with a trailing dot/null indicating the root zone)

    The decode_error alert and a closedown of the connection when using
    empty dane_clientid extensions defined as <1..255>

    - We require ClientName to be non-empty
    - Do we ever need to require an extension with a zero-length ClientName?

    \suggestion{ensure the text properly shows the difference between the TLS length required vs the DANE request length required.}

*** Use stiffer requirements

    \commentfrom{Rick van Rein and Michael Richardson}

    \notes
    - More stiff requirements suggested in order to improve
      interoperability and reduce code complexity
    - "When using X.509 certificate authentication, it SHOULD send
      this extension."

    \suggestion{SHOULD -> MUST}

*** The draft SHOULD say what RR content it expects

    \commentfrom{Robert Moskowitz}

    \notes
    + Interpretation: DANE has multiple usage/etc models now, should
      we specify which are usable in this context?

    \suggestion{drop this suggestion as it adds more strictness than is necessary.  Disagreement about whether or not this should go into this document vs a more specific one if needed.}
    
*** Use case for mixed environments in terms of certificate_authorities

    \commentfrom{Rick van Rein?}

    \notes
    - Use case for mixed environments in terms of certificate_authorities

    \suggestion{???}
