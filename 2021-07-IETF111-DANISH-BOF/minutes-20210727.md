-------------------------------------------------

1. Preliminaries (Chairs, 10 min)
Note Well, Note Takers, Agenda Bashing, Draft status

Jabber scribe: Michael
Note taker: Michael, Robin Wilton



2. The WG Story So Far (Wes)
The core message: if you want this work to continue, you'll have to let the proposers know.

3. Recap problem statement/technology pitch (Ash Wilson)
 https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-111-danish-danish-problem-space-00.pdf
 (Ubiquitous) private PKI domains raise issues of name collision and trust establishment.
 A consistent lookup mechanism would help create bridges between islands of trust.
 Client identity is best kept separate from web PKI (!)
 Example issue: in an IoT deployment, an actuator and a sensor in the same context might have different  server  platforms and therefore different PKIs.
 
 Two drafts exist (see meeting materials for links), one for IoT and one  for SMTP transport security. Drafted in 2015, refreshed in 2020.
 
 An architecture doc is also proposed, but the scope is currently loosely defined.
 One question to the group is whether to do this as an update to RFC 7671 rather than a doc in its own right.
 
Some discussion about why private CAs and NameConstraints are an issue in the chat.
(NameConstrained are not deployed in WebPKI) 

Could Service Authentication use case presented, to contrast traditional PKI (and resulting issues) with the DANISH approach.

Appendix in the presentation materials lists links to relevant docs.

Clarifying questions

kaduk@jabber.org/barnowl: I wonder how the need to trust the manufacturer's 
        issuance compares between this scheme and, e.g., BRSKI 
        
Viktor Dukhovni: is there any indication of manufacturer interest in this approach?
Wes H: group will  come back to the question of interest in implementation
Ash W: supplier-issued PKI remains an issue; also need to deal with concerns that arise if a manufacturer goes out of business and/or  is not issuing firmware updates. The architecture doc would be a good place to explore that.

Shumon Huque_web_844: To Viktor's 1st question, I'm not plugged into IOT companies currently, but back in ~2015/2016 when I was originally working on these drafts at Verisign, we were definitely talking to IOT companies interested in this.

Ben Schwartz (Google): "is the benefit of this approach that device names are human-readable domain names? They are always provisioned out-of-band."
Ash: That's one, but it also makes key rotation easier by decoupling it from the device name.

Lucy Lynch: What happens when a legacy domain is transferred to a new owner? Does that create a security vulnerability?
Ash Wilson: Yes, it would raise security concerns because it would break the link between the original organisation and the devices.

Hannes Tschofenig_web_782: FYI: The IAB published a nice document that explains design patterns of IoT devices and the document also explains how silos can be dealt with (see Section 2.4 of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7452)

Possible question from Kerry Lynn: (audio issues)

4. Chartering discussion (Chairs, AD, 30 mi4)
   https://github.com/mcr/danish-bof/blob/main/charter.md

Wes: Any comments on the Charter as presented?
Viktor D: Has made some suggestions via the list, but has some more to contribute. "Close but good enough."
Wes: We can amend the Charter after formation, and would rather do that than hold things up for endless tweaks...

Paul Wouters_web_335: my only issue here is that this problem statement is incompatible with "a non-dnssec variant much be supported"
mcr: @Paul, we removed the "non-dnssec variant" from the charter for that reason.

Viktor D: On Charter 3, Problem Statement 2,  who is the expected PKI implementer; is it the "application owner", the manufacturer(s) or Other? [I may not have caught that right - RW]

MCR: It could simply be e.g. different people in the deploying organisation who, over time, procured solution elements that introduced different (siloed) PKIs.

mcr suggests "single private PKI" is the origin, and should say, "adjacent private PKI" or something like that.

Bob Moskowitz: The use case text is really clear to me, but I think I am too close to this problem.

Charter (4) - Scope of  work.

Bill Woodcock: regardless of the IoT use case, the client authN use case for DNS connections would justify this in my view.

MCR: (from the chat) What's the relationship between this and StartTLS? We intentionally didn't include language about that.

**Discussion:**

Wes: Any remaining  Charter  text/scope comments?
Viktor: The Charter as written is compatible with SMTP,  no, put that back...

Brendan Moran: Exactly what class of IoT devices is this aimed at? It implies DNSSEC dependencies and potentially key updates every 90 days or so, which could be a constraint for battery-powered devices.
Ash: /Super-light/ IoT devices might not be ideal for this usecase.
Brendan M: DTLS is intended for devices that need a long-term key

Phil Hallam-Baker: One problem here is a good fit (TLS client authN); one is not:DANE maps DNS names to keys via certificates. DNS names require annual renweal, IoT devices should be capable of a 20 year service life. It is not at all clear that there is value in using DNS names in an IoT context. Further, the management of the DNS zone is really problematic. Who has control, the device owner, the device manufacturer, the user? The control of the DNSSEC apex root by ICANN will introduce serious national security issues for certain governments. Russia has already stated their refusal to accept any infrastructures that are subbordinated to a US controlled root. They are not the only governments that will make that objection.

Ben Schwartz: the limiting factor on key life seems to me to be the lifespan of the keys "above" the device in the PKI hierarchy. Seems to me that the Scope should make it clear whether DANE is assumed to be in use, and if not, how you tell.

[Some discussion here about the possible role of gateway-based solutions for constrained devices]

Viktor D: Use DANE when TLSA records are published.
[apologies, I lost audio for a while]


Dan Harkins_web_918: does this have to be TLS-specific? This sounds useful for a server to obtain a device's public key which is useful for TLS but does not necessarily mean you're doing TLS.
mcr: @Dan, I don't think so, but we needed an extension to TLS to be able to carry the name and not the certificate.

DKG: Is the core problem here that the server doesn't, by defalt, know whether a TLS client intends to authenticate using DANE? And this therefore implies an update to the TLS handshake...
Ash: Yes

hhh

DKG raises Security/Privacy Consideration issue with forcing server to do DNS lookup on arbitrary name.

Rich suggests that this system will not be deployable.
Wes: so you object the entire charter and think the WG should not be created?
Rich: yes.
Wes acknowledges that this is a valid concern, but let's not get into this at this stage.

Shumon Huque_web_844: I don't think DANE is limited to TLS. We had an object/message security use case in the original BoF, but the current charter was scoped down to try to get a focussed charter out of the door.

Jacques: deployable, GSMA is working on an IoT / eSIM system called IoT-Safe.  Push on-demand credentials are included. TLS Client side certificates are exactly what IoT-Safe needs to scale.

Bill Woodcock: This lowers the barrier to configuration sufficiently for the intended adopters (i.e. manufacturers) or someone capable of configuring their own mail server.

Timothy Panton: Would this be compatible with Matter [a closed protocol from a vendor consortium] - 
(Hannes T added: consortium includes Apple, Google, Amazon... - some discussion of that in the chat)
Ash: not sure; would have to look into Matter


Ben Shwartz: add something about orphaned devices (by mfgr) in charter.
Should be a Charter item because it has the potential to generate substantial work.

Phil Hallam-Baker: Chat has a lot of discussion about TLS; for clarity, DANE performs two functions - a way to publish keys, and a way to express security policy. 
cPanel doesn't give you an interface to input TLSA records, and someone's going to have to enter them, because registrars aren't going to do it.

Viktor D: Dutch standards bodies are working on adding the cPanel function. Solvable.

MCR: Seeking clarification about PHB's stated cPanel requirement. I'd only need this if configuring it for SMTP use cases. cPanel shouldn't be the UI for this, because the configuration should be done by the manufacturers. Coming back to the question about Matter - the target adopters here really are not householders.

Trent Adams: If that's the intent, suggest stating it explicitly in the Charter.

From the chat: discussion of the relative ephemerality of "home" versus "industrial" device manufacturers.



5. Wrapup and Next Steps (Chairs, 10 min)

Do we have enough interested parties to move this work forward?
(Assuming agreement on Charter text)

Roman: is there something too IoT specific in the work items?

Bill Woodcock: The use cases for DNS and SMTP are clear; IoT only complicates the picture (unnecessarily for what can otherwise be a generic specification)

Viktor D: How to publish client TLSA labels (generically, irrespective of IoT); 

Benjamin Schwartz_web_219: DANe authentication for Inter-Service Handshakes
Scott Rose_web_361: DANE Authenticating Network Clients Everywhere (DANCE).
Lots of support for DANCE in chat.

PHB: the IoT-related work really feels like something that should be decoupled from this specific technical approach.

Wes: tying the work too explicitly to SMTP client authN would be too restrictive, but removing some of the IoT mentions from the WG name and Charter seems to have consensus.

Roman: Concur; support for work items, some concerns about framing, and e.g. if IoT is kept in scope, some people expressed a need for constraints on it to be defined.

Viktor: Should updating RFC 7671 be in scope, given that we now have a few years of hindsight?
Wes: Probably not at the same time as client-side DANE, though we should be careful not to violate  7671 in terms of server-side spec.

Now starts committee-based word-smithing (with the goal of reducing IoT-related complexity to a minimum in the scope of work).

MCR, Henk Bierholz: can address this by amending the Deliverables text to call for an architecture and use cases (as deliverables) and refer to specific examples like SMTP Client, IoT.

Bill Woodcock: Two use-cases, though these need not be described in detail in the Deliverables text.
1 - Authoritative server-to-server receipt of zone file transfers. 
2 - Recursive servers, and being able to distinguish between types of users on various criteria.


Dan: does this all have to be framed in terms of DNS?
Wes: That's the rational starting point because DANE is about DNS... a generic "device signing" architecture would expand the scope too far. 
Shumon: DANE  covers e.g. OpenPGP as well...

Roman: going beyond TLS (thinking of solving for that use case as a Minimum Viable Product) should be a re-charter

[Wordsmithing of the text for the three deliverables - as a precursor to mailing list suggestions]
